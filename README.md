### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am Zhan Kang. Many people mispronounced it as "ç«™æ…·â€œ, but it's actually supposed to be pronounced as "å±•æ…·â€œðŸ˜‚. Don't worry if you don't get it! Call me by my initials "ZK", and i'll definetly be more than happy to respond! :D

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing my personal website with Hakyll! I'm also exploring various methods to keep codes consice and easy to maintain in future. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently refreshing and refining my knowledge in Machine Learning, and hopefully sharpen my overall coding skills!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: If you happen to know me in real-life and wonder why some of my social media username ends with 22 (e.g. zhankang22), that's because the most frequent index number i got in primary and secondary school was actually 22!
- ðŸ’­ Having met many seasoned coders in Polytechnic, i do hope one day my skills can be as refined as their's and that i can guide more to appreciate the art of coding.
